# named-colors
Color picker for named web colors.

This is a slightly modified version of the incredible [Named Colors Wheel](https://arantius.github.io/web-color-wheel/) by [arantius](https://github.com/arantius). Original repo [here](https://github.com/arantius/web-color-wheel).

I've made a few visual changes as per my preferences, and now clicking on a color copies its name to the clipboard, which helps with rapid development.
